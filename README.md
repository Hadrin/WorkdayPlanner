# WorkdayPlanner

This web page will allow the user to plan out their day.
At the very top the user is presented with the current date.
Below this, there are labeled text boxes where the user can enter to-do items for that hourly block
Hours which are currently in the past will be red
The current hour will be yellow
Hours in the future will be blue
Any text inside the boxes which is not saved by using the button will be discarded when the page closes
Any text which is saved will be retained in local storage.
